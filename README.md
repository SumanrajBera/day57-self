# Self Task: Multi-Step Form (Prototype Version)
- Today I decided to create a prototype version of a multi-step form with a bit of everything I have learned so far.
- I implemented the scrolling feature and smooth transitions between steps, including dynamic height adjustments.
- Next steps: I will continue improving this form by adding input validation, plan selection logic, and enhanced animations.
